    <h2>My Personality</h2>

    <h3>Top Three Traits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytical:</strong> I naturally enjoy examining patterns and solving problems, which would align with data analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Disciplined:</strong> I stay consistent with assignments and deadlines, which is essential in both academics and the tech industry.</li>
        <li><strong>Curious:</strong> I enjoy learning new tools and technologies, which helps me grow continuously in my field.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These traits positively impact my academic life by helping me complete projects efficiently,
        understand complex concepts, and remain focused both on my short and long-term goals.

    <h3>My Hero</h3>

    <p>
        My hero is Nipsey Hussle, an American entrepreneur and artist known for
        combining business strategy, ownership, and community development.
        He was not only a musician but also a visionary investor and businessman.
    </p>

    <p>
         He inspired me in so many ways but what inspired me the most about Nipsey Hussle is his entrepreneurial mindset.
        He believed in ownership, long-term investment, and building sustainable
        systems rather than chasing short-term success. He invested in technology,
        real estate, and local businesses to create generational impact.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a Computer Information Systems major with a concentration in Data Analytics
        and a minor in Entrepreneurship, his mindset resonates deeply with me.
        Data analytics allows me to understand patterns and make informed decisions,
        while entrepreneurship encourages me to think strategically and build value.
        Nipsey Hussle’s example motivates me to combine technical skills with
        business intelligence to create innovative solutions in the future.

    <h3>AI Business Review – AI-Based Adaptive Learning Systems</h3>

    <p>
        One AI business idea that caught my eyes was  
		number 4: AI-Based Adaptive Learning Systems. This idea focuses on
        using artificial intelligence to customize educational experiences based on
        how each individual learns best.
    </p>

    <p>
        Adaptive learning systems analyzes both user behavior and learning patterns to
        adjust content accordingly. For example, visual learners may receive more
        graphs and images, while text-based learners may receive written explanations
        and mnemonics. This creates a more efficient and personalized learning
        experience compared to traditional one-size-fits-all education systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a Computer Information Systems major specializing in Data Analytics,
        I find this idea highly relevant. Data analytics plays a critical role in
        collecting and analyzing student performance data to determine learning
        preferences and areas of improvement. With my minor in Entrepreneurship,
        I also recognize its business potential, as adaptive learning systems can
        operate on both subscription-based (B2C) and corporate training (B2B) models.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, ethical concerns should also be considered. These include data privacy,
        student data security, and algorithmic bias. Since the system will be collecting
        personal learning data, strict data protection policies and transparency
        must be implemented. Developers should also ensure fairness in AI models
        to avoid disadvantaging certain groups of learners.
    </p>

    <p>
        An example of an adaptive learning platform is
        <a href="https://www.duolingo.com" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>,
        which uses AI to personalize language learning experiences based on
        user progress and performance.
