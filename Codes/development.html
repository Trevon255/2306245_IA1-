    <h2>Personal Development Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        This section reflects on Chapters 4–7 of <em>Twelve Pillars</em> by Jim Rohn 
        and how the lessons can be applied to my personal and academic life.

    <h3>Chapter 4 – Goals and Relationships</h3>
    <p>
        In this chapter, Michael and Charlie met at Mack’s Diner sharing some life updates, with the
		conversation directed to relationships and career goals. Michael explains that he has been
		improving his relationship with Amy by treating it like a garden, dedicating a lot of effort and
		care. Charlie reminds him that even when a flower blooms, it still needs water and sunlight,
		showing him that relationships require continuous attention (Rohn, 2005).

		The conversation shifts to Michael’s career, where he admits he feels behind and has no clear
		goals. Charlie explains that this may be the reason he’s not progressing as he hopes. Rohn
		(2005) explains that putting goals in writing strengthens commitment and increases clarity,
		making it easier to work toward them. He also shares a lesson that the true value of goals is
		not just achieving them, but who you become in the process of achieving them. He explains
		that breaking goals into long-term, mid-term, and short-term plans makes success more
		manageable and achievable.
    </p>

    <h4>How I Can Apply This</h4>
    <p>
        This chapter reminds me that if I want progress in my life, I must be intentional with
		everything I do. I can’t expect major achievements without clearly defining what I want.
		Writing down my academic and career goals will give me a sense of direction and
		motivation. It also teaches me that growth matters just as much as results. As I work toward
		my goals, I will focus on developing discipline, consistency, and resilience. Just like a garden
		needs consistent care, my goals and relationships require continuous effort if I want them to
		flourish.

    <h3>Chapter 5 – The Proper Use of Time</h3>
    <p>
        Michael and Charlie continued their diner conversation about life and goals. Michael states
		that he feels too busy with work and family to focus on his goals. Charlie shares Mr. Davis’s
		lesson: everyone faces either the light pain of discipline or the heavy pain of regret. He
		explains that aligning daily actions with personal goals prevents a life weighed down by
		missed opportunities. Charlie warns Michael about getting trapped in urgent tasks rather than
		focusing on important ones. He encourages him to design a personal life plan, stressing that
		mastery of time is essential: “Either you run the day, or the day runs you” (Rohn, 2005, p.
		55).
		Michael leaves for an urgent work call but is still inspired, thankful for the guidance, and
		reminded to reflect on priorities.
    </p>

    <h4>How I Can Apply This</h4>
    <p>
        I can focus on what truly matters by prioritizing my goals over urgent tasks, creating a
		personal life plan, practicing daily discipline, and regularly reflecting on how I spend my
		time. Seeking guidance from mentors and learning from their experiences can help me stay
		on track and avoid future regret.

    <h3>Chapter 6 – Surround Yourself With the Best People</h3>
    <p>
        In Chapter 6, Michael meets with Charlie to share how he’s applied what he learned so far,
		like writing his goals and improving his relationship with his wife. Charlie introduces the
		next pillar of success: surrounding yourself with the best people. He explains that the people
		you spend the most time with shape how you think, act, and grow. Michael realizes that being
		around people who lack ambition or positivity can hold him back. Charlie explains that
		personal growth attracts positive influences, and being around motivated, successful people
		brings knowledge, inspiration, and opportunities (Rohn, 2005). He encourages Michael to ask
		himself, “Who am I around?” and “Are they helping me become who I want to be?”
		Choosing relationships that challenge and inspire you is key to growth, while unproductive
		connections can keep you stuck.
	</p>

    <h4>How I Can Apply This</h4>
    <p>
        I can start by examining my closest relationships and finding which ones help me grow and
		which ones hold me back. I should spend more time with people who motivate me, challenge
		me to improve, and share values similar to mine. If I want to achieve my goals, I need people
		around me who believe in progress and push me toward it. At the same time, I can work on
		becoming the kind of person others want to be around, being someone positive, goal-driven,
		and committed to growth.

    <h3>Chapter 7 – Be a Lifelong Learner</h3>
    <p>
        In this chapter, Charlie teaches Michael about the importance of self‐education. He explains
		that while traditional schooling gives you the basics to make a living, it’s continuous learning
		on your own through reading and reflecting that leads to real success and fulfillment. Charlie
		points out that most people stop learning after school, which limits their potential and can
		lead to a life of quiet dissatisfaction (Rohn, 2005). He defines self‐education as a lifelong
		process of growing and improving beyond what you were taught before.

		Charlie shares three key ways to learn: reading books, learning from successful people by
		observing them, and reflecting on your own experiences, both your wins and mistakes. He
		challenges Michael’s old attitude that books were a waste of time, showing that reading opens
		doors to new ideas and opportunities. To get Michael started, Charlie gives him a reading list
		of influential books to choose from. By the end, Michael chooses The Magic of Thinking Big
		and leaves feeling inspired, grateful for Charlie’s mentorship, and motivated to keep learning
		on his own (Rohn, 2005).
    </p>

    <h4>How I Can Apply This</h4>
    <p>
       I can commit to learning beyond school and make it part of my daily life. That means reading
		books that challenge me, learning from people who inspire me, and reflecting on my own
		experiences to grow from them. By making learning a habit, I can improve mentally,
		emotionally, and professionally, and I’ll be ready for opportunities I might have not seen yet.
